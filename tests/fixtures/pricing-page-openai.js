LANGUAGE MODELS

Multiple models, each with different capabilities and price points. Prices can
be viewed in units of either per 1M or 1K tokens. You can think of tokens as
pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words. This paragraph is 35
tokens.



GPT-4 TURBO

With 128k context, fresher knowledge and the broadest set of capabilities, GPT-4
Turbo is more powerful than GPT-4 and offered at a lower price.

ASSISTANTS API

Assistants API and tools (retrieval, code interpreter) make it easy for
developers to build AI assistants within their own applications. Each assistant
incurs its own retrieval file storage fee based on the files passed to that
assistant. The retrieval tool chunks and indexes your files content in our
vector database.

Learn more
[https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8550641-assistants-api#h_061c53c67a]

The tokens used for the Assistant API are billed at the chosen language model's
per-token input / output rates and the assistant intelligently chooses which
context from the thread to include when calling the model

FAQ

   


 * WHAT’S A TOKEN?
   
   You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language
   processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75
   words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about
   900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.
   
   To learn more about how tokens work and estimate your usage…
   
    * Experiment with our interactive Tokenizer tool
      [https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer].
    * Log in to your account and enter text into the Playground. The counter in
      the footer will display how many tokens are in your text.
      


 * WHICH MODEL SHOULD I USE?
   
   We generally recommend that developers use either gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo,
   depending on how complex the tasks you are using the models for are. gpt-4
   generally performs better on a wide range of evaluations, while gpt-3.5-turbo
   returns outputs with lower latency and costs much less per token. We
   recommend experimenting with these models in Playground
   [https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat] to investigate which
   models provide the best price performance trade-off for your usage. A common
   design pattern is to use several distinct query types which are each
   dispatched to the model appropriate to handle them.
   


 * HOW WILL I KNOW HOW MANY TOKENS I’VE USED EACH MONTH?
   
   Log in to your account to view your usage tracking dashboard
   [https://beta.openai.com/account/usage]. This page will show you how many
   tokens you’ve used during the current and past billing cycles.
   


 * HOW CAN I MANAGE MY SPENDING?
   
   You can set a monthly budget in your billing settings
   [https://platform.openai.com/account/limits], after which we’ll stop serving
   your requests. There may be a delay in enforcing the limit, and you are
   responsible for any overage incurred. You can also configure an email
   notification threshold to receive an email alert once you cross that
   threshold each month. We recommend checking your usage tracking dashboard
   [https://platform.openai.com/usage] regularly to monitor your spend.
   


 * IS API ACCESS INCLUDED IN THE CHATGPT PLUS SUBSCRIPTION?
   
   No, OpenAI APIs and ChatGPT Plus subscriptions are billed separately. The API
   has its own pricing, which can be found at https://openai.com/pricing
   [https://openai.com/pricing]. The ChatGPT Plus subscription covers usage on
   chat.openai.com only and costs $20/month.
   


 * DOES PLAYGROUND USAGE COUNT AGAINST MY QUOTA?
   
   Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage.
   


 * HOW IS PRICING CALCULATED FOR COMPLETIONS?
   
   Chat completion
   [https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat] requests are billed
   based on the number of input tokens sent plus the number of tokens in the
   output(s) returned by the API.
   
   Your request may use up to num_tokens(input) + [max_tokens * max(n, best_of)]
   tokens, which will be billed at the per-engine rates outlined at the top of
   this page.
   
   In the simplest case, if your prompt contains 200 tokens and you request a
   single 900 token completion from the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 API, your request
   will use 1100 tokens and will cost [(200 * 0.001) + (900 * 0.002)] / 1000 =
   $0.002.
   
   You can limit costs by reducing prompt length or maximum response length,
   limiting usage of best_of/n , adding appropriate stop sequences, or using
   engines with lower per-token costs.
   


 * HOW IS PRICING CALCULATED FOR FINE-TUNING?
   
   There are two components to fine-tuning pricing: training and usage.
   
   When training a fine-tuned model, the total tokens used will be billed
   according to our training rates [https://openai.com/api/pricing/#quotas].
   Note that the number of training tokens depends on the number of tokens in
   your training dataset and your chosen number of training epochs
   [https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/hyperparameters]. The
   default number of epochs is 4.
   
   (Tokens in your training file * Number of training epochs) = Total training
   tokens
   
   
   Once you fine-tune a model, you’ll be billed only for the tokens you use.
   Requests sent to fine-tuned models are billed at our usage rates
   [https://openai.com/api/pricing/#quotas].
   


 * IS THERE AN SLA ON THE VARIOUS MODELS?
   
   We will be publishing an SLA soon. In the meantime you can visit our Status
   page [https://status.openai.com/] to monitor service availability and view
   historical uptime. If your company or application has specific requirements,
   please contact our sales team [https://openai.com/contact-sales].
   


 * IS THE API AVAILABLE ON MICROSOFT AZURE?
   
   Yes. Azure customers can access the OpenAI API on Azure with the compliance,
   regional support, and enterprise-grade security that Azure offers. Learn more
   [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/openai-service/#overview] or
